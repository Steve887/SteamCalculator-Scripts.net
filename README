This is a fork of the original SteamCalculator Scripts project that has
been ported to .net and allows the data in the Valve Steam store to be
parsed and saved into a SQL Server database.

Fluent NHibernate is used for the DAL, so databases other than SQL Server 2008
are possible, but you'll either have to update the mappings yourself, or ask
me very nicely.

The program is run as a console application, so can be set up on a schedule.
The entire run takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and gets data from all
the country specific Steam stores.

To install:
* Create a new SQL Server 2008 database
* Run the script in the sql folder to create the required tables
* Add your database details to the App.config file
